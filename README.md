# Tools React

This repository will be used to test different react tools.

## Hooks

### useReducer

This hook receives the prev state and an action object, this object
has a type and a payload.

The function must not mutate state, use (map, filter, reducer, etc...)
With the payload you can send data to the reducer

The reducer needs a pure function, no random values
